# Deep Research Explorations

Welcome to the `explorations` directory of the Super-Kit documentation.

## Purpose

When complex technical barriers arise, standard technical implementation tasks pivot into deep-dive research vectors. These can span multiple active sessions. Before proposing a concrete architectural direction or attempting to code an infrastructure change, the AI Agent executing a `/explore` workflow will park structured contextual findings of technology evaluations, dependency matrices, and conceptual theories here.

## Structure

Explorations typically result in:
1. Proofs of Concepts (POC)
2. Feasibility analyses
3. Competitor capability scans

Once evaluated, findings from exploration artifacts naturally funnel into `/docs/decisions/` as an ADR.

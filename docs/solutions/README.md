# Knowledge Base - Solutions

Welcome to the Super-Kit `solutions` directory.

## Purpose

As AI agents traverse the `Compound Loop` (/explore -> /plan -> /work -> /review -> /compound), they document specific technical hurdles, bugs resolved, and successful deployment metrics inside this folder.

This area prevents identical problem re-discovery over subsequent sessions. If a new agent session hits an issue, they perform a search, usually hitting `docs/solutions/patterns/critical-patterns.md`, and inherit the required context.

## Usage

Use the `/compound` slash-command to automatically format and deposit learned information here. Ensure it defines the **"Why"** along with the **"What"** in regard to failed attempts and their eventual resolutions.
